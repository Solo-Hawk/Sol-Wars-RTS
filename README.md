# Sol-Wars-RTS
To learn and understand how to make a game I am learning LibGDX to make a 2D RTS Game as a way of learning both the 
steps in making a game from start to finish as well as understanding how to make a simple AI to compliment my RTS game

## Getting Started

Below is a guide on how to take a copy of the latest game build from the 'release' branch and test the progress so far 


## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8
- Java JRE 8
- IntelliJ
- Android Studio (Latest)

**Optional**
- LibGDX Setup app - get it [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html)

## Setup
    
Clone the 'release' branch latest build.
